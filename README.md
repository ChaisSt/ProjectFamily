This mobile app was created as a solo project for a class in my final semester of college. While I do plan to continue working with it, all future changes will be on a separate repository. 

This project was my first experience with Xamarin(XAML/XML), mobile app development, and SQLite. The purpose of this app is to increase the placement success rate of adoptable children by making it easier for potential families to find these children and connect with their case workers. This is not a new concept, many websites already exist which allow families to view adoptable children, but no mobile apps exist to my knowledge. 

In its current state, it allows case workers and families to create accounts and log in, displaying different interfaces for each account type. Caseworkers are also able to create profiles for their cases, which become immediately available for family viewing. 

In the future, I plan to improve the profile creation process for both account types, adding more error handling, a more official way to verify license numbers, and allowing the upload of images from mobile galleries. I also plan to allow family profiles to send an "intent notification" or "message of intent" to the caseworker, letting them know that they are seriously interested in learning more about a specific child(or case). This would send the families complete profile(including license number, address, and phone number) to the caseworker and allow the caseworker to contact the family or send the case information back.
